# product_ratings
#### Uses React and Firebase to allow ratings from 1 to 5 of individual products indefinitely
- UUIDs are referenced in firebase with rating-<uuid>. Ideally this should be a hash/unqiue to the product
- The robots mock data was used to represent matching resources on a uuid type key (rating-<uuid>)
